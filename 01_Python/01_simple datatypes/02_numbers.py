# Basic arithmetic operations.

addition = 10 + 5
subtraction = 10 - 5
multiplication = 10 * 5
division = 10 / 5
modulus = 10 % 5
exponentiation = 10 ** 5
floor_division = 10 // 5

# order of operations
# Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction

#  Comparison operators
equal = 10 == 5
not_equal = 10 != 5
greater_than = 10 > 5
less_than = 10 < 5

# Logical operators
logical_and = True and False
logical_or = True or False
logical_not = not True

# Identity operators
identity_is = 10 is 5
identity_is_not = 10 is not 5

# Membership operators

membership_in = "a" in "apple"
membership_not_in = "a" not in "apple"

# Bitwise operators
# & (AND)
bitwise_and = 10 & 5
# | (OR)
bitwise_or = 10 | 5
# ^ (XOR)
bitwise_xor = 10 ^ 5
# ~ (NOT)
bitwise_not = ~10
# << (Zero fill left shift)
bitwise_left_shift = 10 << 5
# >> (Signed right shift)
bitwise_right_shift = 10 >> 5
