Slide 1: How the Internet Works

Overview:
The internet is a global network of interconnected devices that communicate via standardized protocols.
It enables the exchange of data, information, and services across the world.
Slide 2: Components of the Internet

Devices:

Include computers, servers, routers, switches, and other network-enabled devices.
Connected via wired or wireless connections.
Protocols:

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundational protocol suite.
Facilitates data transmission, addressing, and routing.
Slide 3: Data Transmission

Packets:

Data is broken down into smaller packets for transmission.
Each packet contains sender and receiver information, as well as the actual data.
Routing:

Routers direct packets across networks to their destination.
Routes are determined based on routing tables and protocols.
Slide 4: Accessing Websites

Domain Names:

Human-readable labels for websites (e.g., www.example.com).
Translated to IP addresses via DNS (Domain Name System).
HTTP/HTTPS:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) are used for accessing web pages.
HTTP for standard communication, HTTPS for secure communication (encrypted).
Slide 5: Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

Role of ISPs:

Provide access to the internet through various technologies (e.g., DSL, cable, fiber).
Connect users to the global network infrastructure.
Bandwidth:

Determines the speed and capacity of internet connections.
Measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), or megabits per second (Mbps).
Slide 6: Conclusion

Key Points:

The internet relies on interconnected devices, protocols, and infrastructure to enable communication and data exchange.
Understanding how the internet works is essential for navigating the digital world effectively.
Future Trends:

Emerging technologies (e.g., IoT, AI, 5G) will continue to shape the internet's evolution and capabilities.
